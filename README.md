# Database From Scratch (C++ 17 Version)

A relational database consists of multiple related tables, that can be linked together using matching column values. Because of this, data in each individual table is often incomplete from the business perspective.  By keeping distinct data in separate tables, we gain clarity and better data management. We can recombine data from multiple tables to ask more complex questions. In this assignment, you'll implement the logic needed to perform a LEFT JOIN, or a RIGHT JOIN.
